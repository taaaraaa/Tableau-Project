## Results
(Fill in which Option you chose, either 1 or 2. List the dataset you selected for the project if you selected Option 2. Also, discuss the visualizations you created, and why. For Option 2, also identify what your data question was, and how you went through the prompts.)

## Challenges 
The biggest challenge I had was realizing that the clean data file I had was not accurate! While trying to create a horizontal bar chart showing the countries that had the most execution over time, I noticed that China's number was way lower than what I had inspected in the raw csv. Over the years, in raw file, China's execution number was denoted by **">1000"**. By digging more into it, I realized that in the cleaning process, this number had been converted to Null, impacting all the statistics and charts. As a result, instead of these values coverting to null and resulting in 0 in Tableau, I put **"1000"** for those values!
